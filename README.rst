Synapse Quickstart
##################

Welcome to the Synapse quickstart!

This guide will show you how to blah blah blah...

Download the quickstart ZIP file from `the github repo`_ and unzip it to your
host filesystem.

Starting your ``Cortex``
========================

To run the docker containers included with this quickstart, you will need to
make sure you have installed docker.  Follow the instructions at `get docker`_
before trying to execute any of the following commands.

Windows
-------

Double-click ``cortex.bat`` from your file explorer to initialize the ``Cortex`` and
start up a shell that you can use to execute commands.

MacOS
-----

Double-click ``cortex.command`` from your file explorer to initialize the ``Cortex`` and
start up a shell that you can use to execute commands.

Linux
-----

Execute ``cortex.sh`` from your terminal to initialize the ``Cortex`` and start up
a shell that you can use to execute commands.

Making sure everything is working
---------------------------------

To make sure your ``Cortex`` is running and all volume mappings are correct,
run the ``helloworld.storm`` example included in ``/data/storm/``::

    python -m synapse.tools.cmdr cell:///vertex/storage 'storm --file /data/storm/helloworld.storm'

If your output looks similar to this, everything is in working order::

    root@380534a376d5:/# python -m synapse.tools.cmdr cell:///vertex/storage 'storm --file /data/storm/helloworld.storm'

    hello world
    complete. 0 nodes in 16 ms (0/sec).
    connection closed...

Once your ``Cortex`` is Running
===============================

Once you have your ``Cortex`` started, you should be able to execute synapse
tools, such as ``cmdr`` or ``csvtool`` from the shell prompt.::

    python -m synapse.tools.cmdr cell:///vertex/storage

Any files present in the ``data`` directory will be mapped into the folder
``/data/`` within the shell and running docker container.  This will allow you
to edit storm scripts, import csv files, and have an easy way to map files from
your host into the docker container.

Examples from our Blog
======================

Importing Data Doesnâ€™t have to hard: Transferring Structured Data at Scale with Csvtool
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In `using csvtool`_ we demonstrate using ``csvtool`` to import and export data from a ``Cortex``. The
examples used in the blog have been included in the ``/data/blogs/using-csvtool`` folder mapped into
the running docker container.

::

    cd /data/blogs/using-csvtool
    python -m synapse.tools.csvtool --csv-header --cli --cortex cell:///vertex/storage ingest.storm ingest.csv
